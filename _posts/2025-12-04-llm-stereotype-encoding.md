This project investigates how large language models encode cultural stereotypes, revealing that LLMs primarily operate through rotating covariance structures in personality space rather than simple mean score shifts. The research challenges traditional assumptions about AI bias and proposes novel mathematical frameworks for understanding stereotype representation in neural language models.

## Research Overview

Traditional approaches to understanding AI bias focus on mean score differences across demographic groups. However, our research reveals a more sophisticated mechanism: LLMs encode cultural stereotypes primarily through rotations of covariance structures in personality space. This finding has profound implications for AI fairness, alignment, and the development of more culturally sensitive language models.
