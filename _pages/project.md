 Project 1: fMRI image reconstruction </span></p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/yy/fMRI-project.png" alt="Project 1 Image" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
  <figcaption><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> fMRI image reconstruction for a single subject using new feature reconstruction techniques:
(a) Displays regions of activation by human voices. 
(b) Shows regions of activation when listening to human voices compared to nature sounds.
(c) Displays regions of activation by nature sounds.

The "voice localizer" dataset is freely available on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676975/">OpenNEUROs</a> (Gorgolewski et al., 2017). 

All figures produced in R.

  <figcaption><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;">  CFI imaging reconstruction, classification, and forecasting of zebrafish larvae during of PTZ induced epileptic seizure. 
  
  An anti-correlation network is mapped, showing ictal patterns in yellow and interictal patterns in blue, across five cycles. This is measured using the R-squared values between CFI series and discovered patterns at each sampled time point. 
  
  Data provided by collaborators; see Zheng et al., (2020) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676975/">details</a>).
