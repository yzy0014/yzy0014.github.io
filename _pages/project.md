- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> B. Project of calcium fluoresces intensity imaging (CFI) reconstruction of zebrafish larvae during of PTZ induced epileptic seizure. 
(a) reconstructed CFI images of the sample across a complete seizure cycle, sampled at $n=10$ equally spaced time points; (b) original CFI images for the same sample, at the same time points as (a); (c) extracted patterns from interictal periods; (d) extracted patterns from ictal periods; (e) averaged calcium fluouresces intensity curve form bodypixels, across five epileptic cycles; (f) anti-correlation network from ictal patterns (yellow), and interictal patterns (blue), across five epileptic cycles, measured with the model $R^2$ of reconstructed image features at each sampled time point against discovered patterns. Data came from collaborator as in Zheng et al., (2020) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676975/">details</a>)
