  <figcaption><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> fMRI image reconstruction for a single subject using new feature reconstruction techniques:
(a) Shows regions of brain activation when listening to human voices compared to nature sounds.
(b) Displays fMRI reconstructions of brain regions activated by nature sounds.
(c) Displays fMRI reconstructions of brain regions activated by human voices. 
The "voice localizer" dataset is freely available on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30676975/">OpenNEUROs</a> (Gorgolewski et al., 2017).

  <figcaption><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;">  CFI imaging reconstruction, classification, and forecasting of zebrafish larvae during of PTZ induced epileptic seizure. (a) Reconstructed CFI images show the zebrafish sample throughout a full seizure cycle, with 10 evenly spaced time points.
(b) The original CFI images are displayed for the same sample and time points.
(c) Patterns are extracted from periods between seizures (interictal).
(d) Patterns are also extracted from periods during seizures (ictal).
(e) The average calcium fluorescence intensity curve is calculated from body pixels over five seizure cycles.
(f) An anti-correlation network is mapped, showing ictal patterns in yellow and interictal patterns in blue, across five cycles. This is measured using the $$R^2$$ value between reconstructed image features and discovered patterns at each time point.
