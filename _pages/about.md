<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> I am a computational scientist and statistician passionate about uncovering patterns and principles in complex data. My work bridges statistics, neuroscience, and AI to understand how the brain works and how machines learn.</span>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> I specialize in high-dimensional statistics, time-series analysis, and manifold-based methods—applying these tools from brain imaging to biomedical research and behaviorial research.</span>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> My interdisciplinary approach draws from diverse academic foundations: I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics (2021) from <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/">Auburn University</a> under <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/faculty/math_stats/billor/index.htm">Dr. Nedret Billor</a>, a M.S. in Psychology (2015) from <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/dan-svyantek/">Dr. Daniel Svyantek</a>, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering (2010) from <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/">HUST</a>. </span>
