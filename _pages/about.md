<h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:1.2em;">Yuan Yuan</h2>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> I am a computational neuroscientist and statistician passionate about uncovering hidden patterns in complex data. My expertise lies in high-dimensional data analysis and functional neuroimaging, where I develop innovative statistical methods to decode the mysteries of the brain and behavior.</span>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> My research toolkit includes cutting-edge techniques such as functional Sure Independence Screening (fSIS), dynamic time-series analysis, and manifold-based methods. I apply these approaches to diverse datasets—from neuroimaging and biostatistics to social behavior and personality research.</span>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> Recently, I've been expanding into theoretical AI research, focusing on AI alignment problems and LLM persona-simulation mechanisms. This work explores the statistical foundations of how large language models simulate human-like personas and the mathematical frameworks needed for safe AI alignment. I have several manuscripts in preparation for top-tier venues including FAccT, ICML, and NeurIPS, addressing both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of these critical AI safety challenges.</span>

<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> My interdisciplinary background provides a unique perspective on linking sophisticated data analysis with biological and psychological insights. I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics (2021) from <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/">Auburn University</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/faculty/math_stats/billor/index.htm">Dr. Nedret Billor</a>, a M.S. in psychology (2015) from <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/dan-svyantek/">Dr. Daniel Svyantek</a>, and a B.S. in Electrical and Information Engineering (2010) from <a href="https://english.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>. </span>
