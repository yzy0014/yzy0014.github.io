<strong>High-Dimensional Statistics & Feature Selection</strong>
<div style="margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:1em;">
Developing novel feature screening techniques for functional data, including Functional Sure Independence Screening (fSIS) for efficient signal identification in high-dimensional datasets like fMRI and EEG.
</div>

<strong>Computational Neuroscience</strong>
<div style="margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:1em;">
Extracting dynamic spectral features from neuroimaging data through time-frequency analysis to understand neural activity patterns and state transitions, with applications to epileptic seizure dynamics and brain state characterization.
</div>

<strong>AI Alignment & LLM Ethics</strong>
<div style="margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:1em;">
Investigating statistical mechanisms underlying large language model behavior, particularly how LLMs encode cultural stereotypes through geometric transformations of personality structures, and proposing novel frameworks for AI alignment.
