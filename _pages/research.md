<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> As a Ph.D. in statistics, I strive to solve real-world problems with advanced mathematics, statistic, and data engineering approaches. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> For statistics approaches, I specialize in functional data analysis, which is essentially a kernel-based method commonly used for time-series data, commonly found in neural recordings, audio/video recordings. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> In mathematics, I focus on machine learning methods based on Riemannian geometry. These methods are designed to analyze correlation matrices and covariance matrices; including matrix comparison, distance calculations, and similarity calculations.</span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> With advanced data engineering skills in R, python, and Matlab, I apply these methods to computational neuroscience (e.g., EEG, fMRI, calcium imaging), bioinformatics (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association analysis), experimental design (e.g., clinical trial simulations), behavioral data analysis, and advanced survey methods. </span>

- <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:0.75em;"> I welcome collaborations from all related fields. You can reach me at:<br>
